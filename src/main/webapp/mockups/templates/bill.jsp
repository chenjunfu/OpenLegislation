BILL NUMBER:S39A

TITLE OF BILL:
An act
to amend the alcoholic beverage control law, in relation to procedures
associated with issuing licenses to sell
liquor for consumption

PURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:
Requires the posting of notice by
certain establishments upon the submission of an application or
application for renewal for a liquor license to sell liquor.

SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:
The alcoholic beverage control law is
amended by adding a new subdivision to chapter 256 of the laws of
1978. This subdivision requires posting within ten days after filing
a new or renewal application to sell liquor at retail. This notice
will remain posted until the date of the hearing or public meeting
specified in such notice. The posting shall specify the application
date, the type of license, the identification number and how to
contact the State Liquor Authority to give a response to the
application. This posting will be of the form prescribed by the
authority either printed or highlighted stating new or renewal for a
liquor license to sell liquor. The applicant will insure that the
notice will remain posted in a conspicuous place at the entrance to
the establishment or proposed establishment where it can be easily
read by passers-by throughout the pendency of the application. These
provisions will only apply to where no retail liquor license has been
previously granted. This will not be applicable to a proposed sale of
an existing business engaged in the retail sale of liquor. Within ten
days of the applicant's receipt of a written request from the
authority, the applicant shall repost such
notice.

JUSTIFICATION:
A majority of licensed premises which serve alcohol and
beer operate as good neighbors. However, there are some
establishments which have caused numerous problems for their
neighbors. In some instances, licensees have exhibited a pattern of
disregard of their patrons' disorderly behavior which repeatedly
disturbs the neighborhoods in which they are located. In others, loud
music emanating from establishments prevents residents from getting a
good night's sleep. The effect of these problem bars in
densely-developed, mixed-use areas is often magnified as residents
live in close proximity to licensed establishments.

While problem bars have led neighbors to make complaints to owners of
establishments and the police, residents are often unfamiliar with
the timeframe in which they may express their complaints and share
their experiences with the State Liquor Authority. Consequently, many
individuals miss these opportunities to express their concerns while
the State Liquor Authority is considering an establishment's
application for a new liquor license or a renewal of a liquor license.


This legislation requires that all establishments post clear notice
when they apply for a new, or renewal liquor license. In addition,
establishments are mandated to post notice of State Liquor Authority
hearings involving their establishment. In this way, the public will
be alerted to upcoming opportunities to bring their issues and
concerns about problem establishments to the attention of the State
Liquor Authority.

Since community members must live with the consequences of problem
establishments, it is essential that they be aware of opportunities
to express their concerns directly to the State Liquor Authority.
Improving public notice will also help provide the State Liquor
Authority with a fuller picture of the impact of problem
establishments, so that the liquor license decisions that they make
will better reflect the totality of circumstances.

PRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:
2006:    A.10049, Reported from Economic Development and
Referred to Codes.
2007-08: A.4584 Third Reading Cal.974.
2009-10: Referred to Economic Development, Referred to
Codes, Rules Report Cal. 64, Ordered to Third Reading Cal. 64.

FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:
To be determined.

EFFECTIVE DATE:
This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after
it shall become law and shall apply to all applications or
applications for renewal made under section 64, 64-a, 64-b, 64-c,
64-d of the alcohol beverage control law with the state liquor
authority on or after such effective date; provided that any rules or
regulations necessary or convenient to implement the provisions of
the act are authorized to be promulgated on or before such
effective date.

 THAT ONLY A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT IS  SUBJECT  TO  PARAGRAPH  C  OF  THIS
 SUBDIVISION AND WAS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A CONTRACT FOR EXCELLENCE FOR THE
 TWO  THOUSAND ELEVEN--TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SCHOOL YEAR SHALL BE  REQUIRED

 INCOMPETENCE IN WHICH YEAR ONE OR YEAR TWO EVALUATIONS WERE ENTERED INTO
 EVIDENCE, AND A HEARING  OFFICER  FINDS  THE  TEACHER  INCOMPETENT,  BUT
 DECIDES NOT TO TERMINATE, THE TEACHER REMAINS IN YEAR TWO STATUS FOR THE
 <div style="page-break-after:always"></div>       S. 6257--C                         33
 SCHOOL  YEAR  IN PROGRESS OR THE FOLLOWING SCHOOL YEAR IF THE FINDING IS

 HEARING OFFICER EXONERATES THE TEACHER OF CHARGES  OF  INCOMPETENCE  THE
 TEACHER  SHALL  REVERT TO YEAR ONE STATUS IF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL
 YEAR OR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FOLLOWING SCHOOL YEAR IF THE FINDING  IS
 MADE IN BETWEEN SCHOOL YEARS.

 PRINCIPAL AND THE VALIDATOR AGREES, AND THE DISTRICT DOES NOT  BRING  AN
 EXPEDITED  PROCEEDING  PURSUANT  TO  SECTIONS  THREE THOUSAND TWENTY AND
 THREE THOUSAND TWENTY-A OF THIS ARTICLE, THE TEACHER MAY APPEAL THE YEAR
 TWO INEFFECTIVE RATING TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE  CITY  SCHOOL  DISTRICT,
 WHO  SHALL  MAKE  A  FINAL  DETERMINATION.  IF THE RATING IS UPHELD, THE

 SPECIFIC PROCEDURES ESTABLISHED IN THIS SUBDIVISION AFTER TWO YEARS FROM
 THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SUBDIVISION, PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT A  FAILURE
 OR   DELAY  IN  ESTABLISHING  THAT  PROCESS  SHALL  NOT  INVALIDATE  ANY
 PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION.

 <br><br>S 3020-a. Disciplinary procedures and penalties. 1. Filing of charges.
 All charges against a person enjoying the benefits of tenure as provided
 in subdivision three of section [<del>one thousand one</del>] ELEVEN  hundred  two,
 and sections [<del>two thousand five</del>] TWENTY-FIVE hundred nine, [<del>two thousand</del>
 <del>five</del>]  TWENTY-FIVE  hundred seventy-three, twenty-five hundred ninety-j,
 three thousand twelve and three thousand fourteen of this chapter  shall
 be  in  writing  and  filed  with  the  clerk or secretary of the school
 district or employing board during the period between the actual opening

 required  to  serve.  Except as provided in subdivision eight of section
 [<del>two thousand five</del>] TWENTY-FIVE hundred  seventy-three  and  subdivision
 seven of section twenty-five hundred ninety-j of this chapter, no charg
 es  under  this section shall be brought more than three years after the

 charge is of misconduct constituting a crime when committed.
 2.  [<del>(a)</del>]  Disposition of charges. A. Upon receipt of the charges, the
 clerk or secretary of the school district or employing board shall imme
 diately notify said board thereof. Within five  days  after  receipt  of
 charges,  the employing board, in executive session, shall determine, by
 a vote of a majority of all the members of such board, whether  probable
 cause  exists  to  bring  a  disciplinary proceeding against an employee
 pursuant to this section. If such determination is affirmative, a  writ
 ten  statement  specifying  (I)  the charges in detail, (II) the maximum
 penalty which will be imposed by the board  if  the  employee  does  not
 request a hearing or that will be sought by the board if the employee is
 found  guilty  of  the charges after a hearing and [<del>outlining</del>] (III) the
 employee's rights under this section, shall be immediately forwarded  to
 <div style="page-break-after:always"></div>       S. 6257--C                         60
 the  accused  employee  by  certified or registered mail, return receipt
 requested or by personal delivery to the employee.
 [<del>(b)</del>] B. The employee may be suspended pending a hearing on the charg
 es  and  the  final  determination thereof. The suspension shall be with
 pay, except the employee may be suspended without pay  if  the  employee
 has  entered  a  guilty  plea to or has been convicted of a felony crime
 concerning the criminal sale or possession of a controlled substance,  a
 precursor of a controlled substance, or drug paraphernalia as defined in
 article  two  hundred twenty or two hundred twenty-one of the penal law;
 or a felony crime involving the physical abuse of a  minor  or  student.
 The  employee  shall be terminated without a hearing, as provided for in
 this section, upon conviction of a sex offense, as defined  in  subpara
 graph two of paragraph b of subdivision seven-a of section three hundred
 five of this chapter.  To the extent this section applies to an employee
 acting  as  a school administrator or supervisor, as defined in subpara
 graph three of paragraph b  of  subdivision  seven-b  of  section  three
 hundred  five of this chapter, such employee shall be terminated without
 a hearing, as provided for in this section, upon conviction of a  felony
 offense  defined  in  subparagraph  two  of  paragraph  b of subdivision
 seven-b of section three hundred five of this chapter.
 [<del>(c)</del>] C. Within ten days of receipt of the statement of  charges,  the
 employee  shall  notify the clerk or secretary of the employing board in
 writing whether he or she desires a hearing on the charges and when  the
 charges concern pedagogical incompetence or issues involving pedagogical
 judgment,  his  or  her  choice  of either a single hearing officer or a
 three member panel, provided that a three  member  panel  shall  not  be
 available where the charges concern pedagogical incompetence based sole
 ly  upon  a  teacher's or principal's pattern of ineffective teaching or
 performance as defined in section three thousand twelve-c of this  arti
 cle. All other charges shall be heard by a single hearing officer.
 [<del>(d)</del>]  D. The unexcused failure of the employee to notify the clerk or
 secretary of his or her desire for a hearing  within  ten  days  of  the
 receipt  of  charges shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing.
 Where an employee requests a hearing in the manner provided for by  this
 section, the clerk or secretary of the board shall, within three working
 days of receipt of the employee's notice or request for a hearing, noti
 fy  the  commissioner  [<del>of  education</del>] of the need for a hearing. If the
 employee waives his or her right to a hearing the employing board  shall
 proceed,  within fifteen days, by a vote of a majority of all members of
 such board, to determine the case and fix the penalty,  if  any,  to  be
 imposed in accordance with subdivision four of this section.
 3.  Hearings.    a. Notice of hearing. Upon receipt of a request for a
 hearing in accordance with subdivision two of this section, the  commis
 sioner  shall  forthwith  notify  the  American  Arbitration Association
 (hereinafter "association") of the need for a hearing and shall  request
 the association to provide to the commissioner forthwith a list of names
 of  persons  chosen  by  the association from the association's panel of
 labor arbitrators to potentially serve as hearing officers together with
 relevant biographical information on each arbitrator.  Upon  receipt  of
 said list and biographical information, the commissioner shall forthwith
 send  a  copy  of  both  simultaneously  to  the employing board and the
 employee. The commissioner shall also  simultaneously  notify  both  the
 employing  board  and  the  employee of each potential hearing officer's
 record in the last five cases  of  commencing  and  completing  hearings
 within the time periods prescribed in this section.

 TWELVE SHALL BE PAID FROM AN APPROPRIATION FOR SUCH PURPOSE IN THE ORDER
 IN WHICH THEY HAVE  BEEN  APPROVED  BY  THE  COMMISSIONER  FOR  PAYMENT,
 PROVIDED PAYMENT SHALL FIRST BE MADE FOR ANY OTHER HEARING COSTS PAYABLE
 BY THE COMMISSIONER, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF TRANSCRIBING THE RECORD, AND
 PROVIDED FURTHER THAT NO SUCH CLAIM SHALL BE SET ASIDE FOR INSUFFICIENCY
 OF FUNDS TO MAKE A COMPLETE PAYMENT, BUT SHALL BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PARTIAL
 PAYMENT IN ONE YEAR AND SHALL RETAIN ITS PRIORITY DATE STATUS FOR APPRO
 PRIATIONS DESIGNATED FOR SUCH PURPOSE IN FUTURE YEARS.
 (B)  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW, RULE OR REGULATION TO
 THE CONTRARY, FOR HEARINGS COMMENCED BY THE  FILING  OF  CHARGES  ON  OR
 AFTER  APRIL  FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND TWELVE, THE HEARING OFFICER SHALL BE
 COMPENSATED FOR HIS OR HER ACTUAL  HOURS  OF  SERVICE  RENDERED  IN  THE
 PERFORMANCE  OF  HIS OR HER DUTIES AS A HEARING OFFICER, PLUS ANY NECES
 SARY TRAVEL OR OTHER EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH DUTIES

 HOURS THAT MAY BE CLAIMED.
 (ii)  Not later than ten days after the date the commissioner mails to
 the employing board and the employee the list of potential hearing offi
 cers and biographies provided to the commissioner  by  the  association,
 the  employing  board  and  the  employee, individually or through their

 a hearing officer from said list.
 (iv) In those cases in which the employee elects to have  the  charges

 employing  board, from a list maintained for such purpose by the commis

 sional  personnel  without administrative or supervisory responsibility,
 chief school administrators, members  of  employing  boards  and  others
 selected  from lists of nominees submitted to the commissioner by state

 [<del>chairman</del>] CHAIRPERSON of the hearing panel.
 c. Hearing procedures. (i) (A) The commissioner [<del>of  education</del>]  shall
 have  the  power  to  establish  necessary  rules and procedures for the
 conduct of hearings under this section WHICH, FOR  HEARINGS  OTHER  THAN
 EXPEDITED  HEARINGS  PURSUANT  TO  SUBPARAGRAPH (I-A) OF THIS PARAGRAPH,
 SHALL INCLUDE SPECIFIC TIMELINE REQUIREMENTS FOR  CONDUCTING  A  HEARING
 AND FOR RENDERING A FINAL DECISION.
 (B)  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL BE AUTHORIZED TO MONITOR AND INVESTIGATE A
 HEARING OFFICER'S COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH TIMELINES, AS SET  FORTH  IN  THE
 REGULATIONS  OF THE COMMISSIONER. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ANNUALLY INFORM
 ALL HEARING OFFICERS WHO HAVE  HEARD  CASES  PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SECTION
 DURING  THE PRECEDING YEAR THAT THE TIME PERIODS PRESCRIBED IN THE REGU
 LATIONS OF THE COMMISSIONER FOR  CONDUCTING  SUCH  HEARINGS  ARE  TO  BE
 STRICTLY  FOLLOWED.    A  RECORD  OF  CONTINUED  FAILURE TO COMMENCE AND
 COMPLETE HEARINGS WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS PRESCRIBED IN THE  REGULATIONS
 AUTHORIZED  BY  THIS  SUBPARAGRAPH  SHALL  BE CONSIDERED GROUNDS FOR THE
 COMMISSIONER TO EXCLUDE SUCH INDIVIDUAL FROM THE LIST OF POTENTIAL HEAR
 ING OFFICERS SENT TO THE EMPLOYING BOARD AND THE EMPLOYEE FOR SUCH HEAR
 INGS.
 (C) Such rules shall not require compliance with  technical  rules  of
 evidence.  Hearings  shall  be conducted by the hearing officer selected
 pursuant to paragraph b of this subdivision with full and  fair  disclo
 sure  of the nature of the case and evidence against the employee by the
 employing board and shall be public or private at the discretion of  the
 employee.  The  employee  shall  have a reasonable opportunity to defend
 himself or herself and an opportunity to  testify  in  his  or  her  own
 behalf.  The employee shall not be required to testify. Each party shall
 have the right to be represented by counsel, to subpoena witnesses,  and
 to  cross-examine  witnesses.  All  testimony  taken shall be under oath
 which the hearing officer is hereby authorized to administer.
 [<del>A</del>] (D) FOR HEARINGS COMMENCED BY THE FILING OF CHARGES PRIOR TO APRIL
 FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWELVE, A competent stenographer, designated by  the
 commissioner  [<del>of  education</del>]  and  compensated by the [<del>state education</del>]
 department, shall keep and transcribe a record  of  the  proceedings  at
 each  such hearing. A copy of the transcript of the hearings shall, upon
 request, be furnished without charge to the employee and  the  board  of
 education involved.
 (E)  HEARINGS  COMMENCED  BY  THE  FILING OF CHARGES ON OR AFTER APRIL
 FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWELVE, SHALL NOT BE RECORDED BY A  STENOGRAPHER  OR
 ANY  OTHER  RECORDING  MECHANISM  UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE PRIOR TO THE
 COMMENCEMENT OF THE DISCIPLINARY HEARING. THE PARTY REQUESTING  A  TRAN
 SCRIPT OR RECORDING AT A DISCIPLINARY HEARING MAY PROVIDE FOR ONE AT ITS
 <div style="page-break-after:always"></div>       S. 6257--C                         63
 OWN  EXPENSE  AND  SHALL  PROVIDE A COPY TO THE ARBITRATOR AND THE OTHER
 PARTY UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO SHARE THE COST OF SUCH TRANSCRIPT  OR
 RECORDING.  THE  USE  OF A TRANSCRIPT CANNOT DELAY THE HEARING AND SHALL
 NOT EXTEND THE DATE THE HEARING IS CLOSED.
 (i-a)(A) Where charges of incompetence are brought based solely upon a
 pattern of ineffective teaching or performance of a classroom teacher or
 principal,  as  defined in section three thousand twelve-c of this arti
 cle, the hearing shall be conducted before and by a single hearing offi
 cer in an expedited hearing, which  shall  commence  within  seven  days
 after  the  pre-hearing  conference  and shall be completed within sixty
 days after the pre-hearing conference. The hearing officer shall  estab
 lish a hearing schedule at the pre-hearing conference to ensure that the
 expedited  hearing  is  completed  within the required timeframes and to
 ensure an equitable distribution of days between the employing board and
 the charged employee. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or  regulation
 to  the  contrary,  no adjournments may be granted that would extend the
 hearing beyond such sixty days, except as authorized  in  this  subpara
 graph.  A  hearing  officer,  upon request, may grant a limited and time
 specific adjournment that would extend the  hearing  beyond  such  sixty
 days if the hearing officer determines that the delay is attributable to
 a  circumstance  or  occurrence  substantially beyond the control of the
 requesting party and an injustice would result if the  adjournment  were
 not granted.
 (B)  Such  charges shall allege that the employing board has developed
 and substantially implemented a teacher or principal improvement plan in
 accordance with subdivision four of section three thousand  twelve-c  of
 this  article  for  the employee following the first evaluation in which
 the employee was rated ineffective, and the immediately preceding evalu
 ation if the employee was rated developing.  Notwithstanding  any  other
 provision  of  law to the contrary, a pattern of ineffective teaching or
 performance as defined in section three thousand twelve-c of this  arti
 cle  shall  constitute  very  significant  evidence  of incompetence for
 purposes  of  this  section.  Nothing  in  this  subparagraph  shall  be
 construed  to limit the defenses which the employee may place before the
 hearing officer in challenging the allegation of a pattern  of  ineffec
 tive teaching or performance.
 (C)  The  commissioner  shall annually inform all hearing officers who
 have heard cases pursuant to this section during the preceding year that
 the time periods prescribed in this subparagraph  for  conducting  expe
 dited  hearings are to be strictly followed. A record of continued fail
 ure to commence and complete expedited hearings within the time  periods
 prescribed  in  this  subparagraph  shall  be considered grounds for the
 commissioner to exclude such individual from the list of potential hear
 ing officers sent to the employing board and the employee for such expe
 dited hearings.
 (ii) The hearing officer selected to  conduct  a  hearing  under  this
 section shall, within ten to fifteen days of agreeing to serve [<del>as such</del>]
 IN  SUCH  POSITION, hold a pre-hearing conference which shall be held in
 the school district or county seat of the county, or any county, wherein
 the employing school board is located. The pre-hearing conference  shall
 be  limited in length to one day except that the hearing officer, in his
 or her discretion, may allow one additional day for good cause shown.
 (iii) At the pre-hearing conference the hearing officer shall have the
 power to:<br>
 (A) issue subpoenas;
 <div style="page-break-after:always"></div>       S. 6257--C                         64
 (B) hear and decide all motions, including but not limited to  motions
 to dismiss the charges;
 (C)  hear  and  decide  all  applications  for  bills of particular or
 requests for production of materials or information, including, but  not
 limited  to, any witness statement (or statements), investigatory state
 ment (or statements) or note (notes), exculpatory evidence or any  other
 evidence,  including  district or student records, relevant and material
 to the employee's defense.
 (iv) Any pre-hearing motion or application relative to the sufficiency
 of the charges, application or amendment  thereof,  or  any  preliminary
 matters shall be made upon written notice to the hearing officer and the
 adverse  party no less than five days prior to the date of the pre-hear
 ing conference. Any pre-hearing motions  or  applications  not  made  as
 provided  for  herein  shall  be  deemed waived except for good cause as
 determined by the hearing officer.
 (v) In the event that at  the  pre-hearing  conference  the  employing
 board  presents  evidence  that the professional license of the employee
 has been revoked and all judicial and administrative remedies have  been
 exhausted  or  foreclosed,  the hearing officer shall schedule the date,
 time and place for an expedited hearing, which  hearing  shall  commence
 not  more  than  seven  days  after the pre-hearing conference and which
 shall be limited to one day. The expedited hearing shall be held in  the
 local school district or county seat of the county or any county, where
 in  the said employing board is located. The expedited hearing shall not
 be postponed except upon the request of a party and then only  for  good
 cause  as determined by the hearing officer. At such hearing, each party
 shall have equal time in which to present its case.
 (vi) During the pre-hearing  conference,  the  hearing  officer  shall
 determine the reasonable amount of time necessary for a final hearing on
 the  charge  or  charges  and  shall  schedule the location, time(s) and
 date(s) for the final hearing. The final hearing shall be  held  in  the
 local school district or county seat of the county, or any county, wher
 ein  the  said  employing school board is located. In the event that the
 hearing officer determines that the nature  of  the  case  requires  the
 final hearing to last more than one day, the days that are scheduled for
 the  final  hearing  shall be consecutive. The day or days scheduled for
 the final hearing shall not be postponed except upon the  request  of  a
 party  and  then  only for good cause shown as determined by the hearing
 officer. In all cases, the final hearing shall  be  completed  no  later
 than  sixty  days  after  the  pre-hearing conference unless the hearing
 officer determines that extraordinary circumstances  warrant  a  limited
 extension.
 D.  LIMITATION  ON CLAIMS. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW,
 RULE OR REGULATION TO THE CONTRARY, NO PAYMENTS SHALL  BE  MADE  BY  THE
 DEPARTMENT  PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SUBDIVISION ON OR AFTER APRIL FIRST, TWO
 THOUSAND TWELVE FOR: (I) COMPENSATION OF A HEARING  OFFICER  OR  HEARING
 PANEL  MEMBER,  (II)  REIMBURSEMENT  OF  SUCH  HEARING OFFICERS OR PANEL
 MEMBERS FOR NECESSARY TRAVEL OR OTHER  EXPENSES  INCURRED  BY  THEM,  OR
 (III)  FOR  OTHER  HEARING  EXPENSES ON A CLAIM SUBMITTED LATER THAN ONE
 YEAR AFTER THE FINAL DISPOSITION OF THE HEARING BY ANY MEANS,  INCLUDING
 SETTLEMENT, OR WITHIN NINETY DAYS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS PARA
 GRAPH,  WHICHEVER  IS LATER; PROVIDED THAT NO PAYMENT SHALL BE BARRED OR
 REDUCED WHERE SUCH PAYMENT IS REQUIRED AS A RESULT OF A COURT  ORDER  OR
 JUDGMENT OR A FINAL AUDIT.
 4.  Post hearing procedures. [<del>(a)</del>] A. The hearing officer shall render
 a written decision within thirty days of the last day of the final hear
 <div style="page-break-after:always"></div>       S. 6257--C                         65
 ing, or in the case of an expedited hearing  within  ten  days  of  such
 expedited  hearing,  and shall [<del>forthwith</del>] forward a copy thereof to the
 commissioner [<del>of education</del>] who shall immediately forward copies of  the
 decision  to the employee and to the clerk or secretary of the employing
 board. The written decision shall include the hearing officer's findings
 of fact on each charge, his or  her  conclusions  with  regard  to  each
 charge  based  on  said  findings  and shall state what penalty or other
 action, if any, shall be taken by the employing board. At the request of
 the employee, in determining what, if any, penalty or other action shall
 be imposed, the hearing officer shall consider the extent to  which  the
 employing  board  made  efforts  towards  correcting the behavior of the
 employee which resulted in charges  being  brought  under  this  section
 through  means  including  but  not limited to: remediation, peer inter
 vention or an employee assistance plan. In those cases where  a  penalty
 is  imposed, such penalty may be a written reprimand, a fine, suspension
 for a fixed time without pay, or dismissal. In addition to or in lieu of
 the aforementioned penalties, the hearing officer, where he or she deems
 appropriate, may impose upon the employee remedial action including  but
 not  limited to leaves of absence with or without pay, continuing educa
 tion and/or study, a requirement that the employee  seek  counseling  or
 medical  treatment  or that the employee engage in any other remedial or
 combination of remedial actions.
 [<del>(b)</del>] B. Within fifteen days of receipt of the hearing officer's deci
 sion the employing board shall implement the decision. If  the  employee
 is  acquitted  he  or  she shall be restored to his or her position with
 full pay for any period  of  suspension  without  pay  and  the  charges
 expunged from the employment record. If an employee who was convicted of
 a felony crime specified in paragraph [<del>(b)</del>] B of subdivision two of this
 section,  has  said conviction reversed, the employee, upon application,
 shall be entitled to have his OR HER pay and other emoluments  restored,
 for the period from the date of his OR HER suspension to the date of the
 decision.
 [<del>(c)</del>]  C.  The  hearing officer shall indicate in the decision whether
 any of the charges brought by the  employing  board  were  frivolous  as
 defined  in  section [<del>eight thousand three</del>] EIGHTY-THREE hundred three-a
 of the civil practice law and rules. If the hearing  [<del>officers</del>]  OFFICER
 finds  that  all of the charges brought against the employee were frivo
 lous, the hearing officer shall order the employing board  to  reimburse
 the  [<del>state  education</del>]  department the reasonable costs said department
 incurred as a result of the proceeding and to reimburse the employee the
 reasonable costs, including but not  limited  to  reasonable  attorneys'
 fees,  the  employee  incurred  in defending the charges. If the hearing
 officer finds that some but not all of the charges brought  against  the
 employee  were  frivolous, the hearing officer shall order the employing
 board to reimburse the [<del>state education</del>] department a  portion,  in  the
 discretion  of the hearing officer, of the reasonable costs said depart
 ment incurred as a result of the proceeding and to reimburse the employ
 ee a portion, in the discretion of the hearing officer, of  the  reason
 able costs, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees, the
 employee incurred in defending the charges.

 officer's decision, the employee or the  employing  board  may  make  an
 application  to the New York state supreme court to vacate or modify the
 decision of the hearing officer  pursuant  to  section  [<del>seven  thousand</del>
 <del>five</del>]  SEVENTY-FIVE  hundred eleven of the civil practice law and rules.
 The court's review shall be limited to the grounds  set  forth  in  such

 section.  The  hearing panel's determination shall be deemed to be final
 for the purpose of such proceeding.
 B.  In no case shall the filing or the pendency of an appeal delay the
 implementation of the decision of the hearing officer.
 <br><br>S 2. This act shall take effect immediately, except that if  this  act
 shall  have  become  a law on or after April 1, 2012 this act shall take
 effect immediately and shall be deemed to have been in  full  force  and

 authorize the city of New York to provide juvenile justice  services  to
 adjudicated  juvenile delinquents who reside in the city, and are deter
 mined by the family court to need placement in  a  non-secure  facility.
 This  legislation  aims  to  transform  the  juvenile  justice system by
 authorizing the city to develop a system for its youth that strives to:<br>
 a) provide an effective continuum of diversion, supervision, treatment
 and confinement, ensuring that the most appropriate  level  of  care  is
 provided  for  youth, consistent with public safety, keeping youth close
 to home, minimizing the dislocation of youth  from  their  families  and
 building on positive connections between young people and their communi
 ties;
 b)  provide  accountability of the system and organizations within the
 system, ensuring that both internal and external  mechanisms  for  over
 sight of the system are maintained;
 c) be data-driven, ensuring that objective instruments are employed at
 all key decision making stages and that system actors readily and trans
 parently share information to inform ongoing changes in policy and prac
 tice;
 d)  promote  family  and community involvement, ensuring that positive
 family and community supports are actively engaged;
 e) be based on evidence-informed practices, ensuring that programs and
 services provided are shown to have worked  in  improving  outcomes  for
 youth,  maintaining  public  safety and reducing unnecessary confinement
 and recidivism and unwarranted racial/ethnic disparities; and
 f) provide  effective  reintegration  services,  ensuring  that  youth
 remain connected to appropriate educational services and positive behav
 ioral  supports and/or treatment modalities upon transitioning home from
 placement.

 fiscal year. Any unspent amount associated with such  county  agreements
 shall not be available for payments to other counties or municipalities.
